2.0 (hikitsuboshi) 2007/11/xx
      * Version 2.0

      * Incompatibility since pgpool-II 1.x
        - the default value for ignore_leading_white_space is now
          true(Yoshiyuki) 

      * General
        - Allow to reload pgpool.conf(Yoshiyuki)
        - The paraser is now compatible with PostgreSQL 8.3(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "failover_command" to specify command when
          a node is detached(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "client_idle_limit" to specify the time out since
          the last command is arrived from a client(Tatsuo)
  
      * Replication
        - Always start a new transaction even if the query is not in
          an explicit transaction to enhance the reliabilty of
          replication(Yoshiyuki)
        - Enhance the performance of replication for write
          queries. Now the worst case is 1/2 compared with single DB
          node regardless the number of DB nodes. Previous release
          tends to degrade according to the numer of DB
          nodes(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add "online recovery" which allows to add a DB node and sync
          with other DB nodes without stopping the pgpool
          server(Yoshiyuki)
        - Abort a transaction if INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE reports
          different number of result rows(Yoshiyuki)

          x=# update t set a = a + 1;
          ERROR:  pgpool detected difference of the number of update tuples
          HINT:  check data consistency between master and other db node

        - If the results from DB nodes do not match, select the
          possible correct result by "decide by majority". Previous
          release always trust the result of the master DB
          node(Yoshiyuki)
        - Allow load balance in V2 frontend/backend protocol(Yoshiyuki)

      * Parallel query
        - Allow "partial replication" to enhance the performance of
          the parallel query(Yoshiharu)

1.3 (sohiboshi) 2007/10/23
      * Version 1.3
      * Add new "authentication_timeout" directive, being the default
        value is 60. (Yoshiyuki)

        10,000 byte. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix invalid memory access when pgpool processed DEALLOCATE
        statement. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix hang up in load balance mode. (Yoshiyuki)
        - This was introduced in V1.2.
      * Fix segmentation fault in 64-bit environment when query cache
        is enable. (Yoshiyuki)

1.2 (tomoboshi) 2007/08/01
      * Version 1.2
      * Add new "replicate_select" directive, being the default value

	  same as V3.2 or earlier.
      * Improve signal handling. (Yoshiyuki)
        - Occasionaly, zombie processes were remained. Or processes
	  were unstable.
      * Fix hang up when SELECT was error inside a transaction
        block. The bug was introduced in V3.3. (Yoshiyuki)
