.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpgpool\fR is a connection pool server for PostgreSQL.
\fBpgpool\fR runs between PostgreSQL's client and server.
Any PostgreSQL client can connect to \fBpgpool\fR as if it's a real PostgreSQL server.
\fBpgpool\fR caches the connection to the PostgreSQL server to reduce the overhead
involved in establishing the connection to it.
.P
\fBpgpool\fR can also be
used with two PostgreSQL servers for fail over purposes.  If the first
server goes down, \fBpgpool\fR will automatically switch to the secondary server.
.P
\fBpgpool\fR is typically started and stopped via system initialization scripts.
